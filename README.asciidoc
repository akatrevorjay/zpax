Overview
--------

This repository provides an implementation of a simple Paxos-coordinated
key-value database that uses ZeroMQ for message transport. The code is 
currently experimental and contains comparatively little documentation.
However, the implementation is not complex. Those interested in ZeroMQ and/or
distributed concensus are encouraged to investigate and modify this code.
