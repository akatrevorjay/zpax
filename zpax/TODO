Durability
  basic.Node -- add pickle meth to ignore teh callback
    * multi.MultiPaxos manually resets it (via method) on deserial
  |-> Should scale to custom nodes that use custom MultiPaxos classes
      on load, they can fix up any markers left by their known subclasses.

  Put durability into MultiPaxos class then.
